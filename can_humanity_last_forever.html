<h2 id="blogtitle">Can Humanity Last Forever?</h2>
<p>I have been interested in the concept of existential risk for a while. Toby Ord defines it like this:</p>
<div>
    <b>"An existential catastrophe is the destruction of humanityâ€™s longterm potential."</b>,
    <a href="https://theprecipice.com/" target="_blank">The Precipice</a> (p. 37)
</div>
<p>
    To establish how valuable it is to prevent an existential catastrophe in our lifetimes, we need to find out how long
    humanity will last if we are successful. <br>
    More specifically, we can ask:
</p>
<p><b>Given that no existential catastrophe occurs before the year 2100. What is the expected number of centuries
    before an existential catastrophe occurs?
</b></p>
<p>
    I definitely don't know how to answer this question, but I will make an attempt at answering one aspect:
</p>
<p>
    <b>Can the answer be infinite?</b>
</p>
<p>
    My immediate thought when thinking about this, was that it would be impossible. My thinking was that any non-zero
    probability of an existential catastrophe, <br>
    if repeated over enough centuries, would bring existential risk arbitrarily close to 100%.
