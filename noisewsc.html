<h2 id="blogtitle">Measuring noise pollution at the World Ski Championship</h2>
<p>
    This was a school project in 2025 as a part of <a href="https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Experts+in+Teamwork">Experts in Teamwork</a> at <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu">NTNU</a>.
    <br>
    My team consisted of me, Halvard Christoffersen, Olav Irgens Henanger, Rickard Jonassen, Morten Lindekleiv, Eryk Bartlomiej Siejka and Andreas Sollid Vanberg.
</p>
<p>
    Our aim was to figure out to what extent the WSC had an effect on noise levels in the residential areas closest to the arena, and in the city centre.
    We measured noise levels before and during the event to establish this.
